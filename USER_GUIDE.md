# Welcome to Spirtz Voice

Spirtz Voice helps you read faster and listen to your documents at the same time. It works right in your browser, even offline, so your privacy is protected.

## Getting Started

You can use Spirtz Voice directly in your browser without installing anything. However, installing it gives you a better full-screen experience and makes it easier to find later.

### Optional: How to Install

* **On Computer (Chrome/Edge):** Look for the install icon (usually a computer screen with a download arrow) in your browser's address bar, or click the "Install App" button inside the app.
* **On Android:** Tap the menu button (three dots) in your browser and select **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"**.
* **On iPhone/iPad:** Tap the Share button (box with an arrow) and select **"Add to Home Screen"**.

## How to Add Books & Articles

Your **Library** is where you keep everything you want to read.

1. **Paste Text:** Click the **New Document** icon (looks like a file). You can paste any text you copied from a website or email.
2. **Open Files:** If you have a file on your device (like a `.txt` or `.md` file), you can drag and drop it right into the app window.
3. **Web Clipper:** Drag the "Clip to Spirtz" button from the **Info & Help** section to your bookmarks bar. Then, click it on any website to instantly send that article here.

## Ways to Read

Spirtz Voice has three ways to show you text. You can switch between them anytime.

### 1. Speed Reader (RSVP)

* **What it is:** Shows you one word at a time in the center of the screen.
* **Why use it:** It stops your eyes from moving around, which lets you read much faster than usual.
* **Tip:** Look at the red letter in the middle of the word to stay focused.

### 2. Paragraph View

* **What it is:** Shows the text like a normal book or article.
* **Why use it:** Great for reading normally while listening to the voice. The app will automatically highlight the words as they are spoken.

### 3. Focus View

* **What it is:** A distraction-free mode that hides all buttons and controls, showing only the text.
* **Why use it:** Perfect for deep reading when you don't want to be disturbed by the interface.

## Controlling the Voice

At the bottom of the screen, you'll see the controls:

* **Play / Pause:** Start or stop reading.
* **Slider:** Move back and forth through the text.
* **Arrows:** Skip to the previous or next paragraph.

## Customizing Your Experience

Click the **Settings** (gear icon) to make the app work for you.

* **Voice:** Pick a voice you like. The app tries to pick the best one for the language you are reading.
* **Speed (WPM):** Change how fast the voice speaks and the words appear. **WPM** stands for **Words Per Minute**.
  * *Tip:* 250 WPM is a good reading speed for most people.
* **Theme:** Switch to **Dark Mode** if you are reading at night.
* **Text Size:** Make the text bigger or smaller in Paragraph view.

## Handy Keyboard Shortcuts

If you are on a computer, you can use these keys:

* **Spacebar:** Play or Pause
* **Plus (+):** Go faster
* **Minus (-):** Go slower
* **Arrow Keys:** Skip forward or backward
* **Escape:** Switch back to normal view

## Tips

* **Start Slow:** If the Speed Reader feels too fast, slow it down until you get used to it.
* **Offline:** Once you load the app, you can use it anywhere—even on an airplane!
